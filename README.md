Abstract
This case study examines the categorization of 40 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on the Aragon platform, a leading DAO-as-a-service provider managing over $6 billion in crypto-assets. Drawing on Peña-Calvin et al. (2023), it analyzes DAOs across 15 dimensions, including domain, purpose, voting processes, and token usage, using qualitative and statistical methods. Findings reveal a dominance of finance and technology DAOs, with 77.5% employing token-weighted voting, resembling plutocracies. Archetypes highlight governance and token diversity, yet small DAOs face sustainability challenges. Supplemented by 24 web sources and X posts, the study underscores governance inequities and limited domain diversity. It contributes to blockchain governance literature by offering a replicable framework and actionable recommendations for equitable DAO design, broader applications, and regulatory clarity. Implications address researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to advance decentralized organizations.
Keywords: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Aragon, blockchain governance, tokenomics, DAO archetypes, plutocracy.

1. Introduction
Background and Context
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) leverage blockchain technology to enable decentralized, transparent governance through smart contracts. Emerging with Ethereum in 2015, DAOs have grown to manage $37 billion globally across 13,000 organizations, with applications in finance, technology, and social governance. The Aragon platform, supporting over 5,000 DAOs, is a pioneer in DAO creation, offering tools like the Aragon Client and Governance Designer. Its 2023 merger with Nation3 aims to establish digital jurisdictions, reflecting DAOs’ potential to redefine organizational models.
Significance of the Case
Aragon’s scale and diversity make it an ideal case for studying DAO governance. Peña-Calvin et al. (2023) categorize 40 DAOs, representing 423,000 participants and $960 million in treasuries, providing a robust dataset to explore governance structures, tokenomics, and sustainability. Understanding these patterns informs DAO design and addresses challenges like plutocratic voting and limited sector diversity.
Research Questions
What are the key characteristics and archetypes of Aragon DAOs?
How do governance structures and tokenomics influence DAO sustainability and equity?
What are the implications for DAO design and regulation?
Objectives
Analyze the categorization of Aragon DAOs by Peña-Calvin et al. (2023).
Identify governance and tokenomic patterns and their impact on DAO performance.
Propose recommendations for equitable governance and broader DAO applications.
Scope and Limitations
The study focuses on 40 Aragon DAOs, excluding other platforms like DAOstack or DAOhaus. Data limitations (e.g., 47.5% missing treasury data) and reliance on curated lists may introduce bias. The analysis integrates external sources to enhance generalizability but is constrained by the availability of peer-reviewed DAO studies.

3. Literature Review
Review of Prior Research
DAO research has grown since The DAO’s 2016 hack, focusing on governance, tokenomics, and applications. Faqir-Rhazoui et al. (2021) categorize DAOs by purpose (e.g., investment, protocol), while Bellavitis et al. (2023) highlight governance challenges, noting token concentration risks. Hassan and De Filippi (2021) argue DAOs often resemble plutocracies due to token-weighted voting, a finding echoed in Aragon’s ecosystem. DeepDAO and Messari provide quantitative insights, estimating 13,000 DAOs managing $37 billion, but lack archetype-based analyses like Peña-Calvin et al. (2023).

Theoretical Framework
The study adopts a socio-technical systems framework, viewing DAOs as interactions between technical (blockchain, smart contracts) and social (governance, community) elements. Agency theory explains token-driven incentives, while stewardship theory highlights collaborative ideals, providing a lens to analyze governance tensions.
Research Gaps
Few studies offer comprehensive DAO categorizations or archetypes, with most focusing on single platforms or qualitative case studies. Quantitative analyses of voting and tokenomics are limited, and cross-platform comparisons are rare. The role of small DAOs and non-financial applications remains underexplored.
Justification
This case study addresses these gaps by leveraging Peña-Calvin et al.’s (2023) detailed dataset and archetypes, supplemented by external sources, to provide a holistic view of Aragon DAOs. It bridges theoretical and practical insights, informing DAO design and policy.

3. Methodology
Type of Case Study
This is an instrumental case study, using Aragon DAOs to understand broader DAO governance dynamics.
Research Design
Qualitative, building on Peña-Calvin et al.’s (2023) mixed-methods approach, with descriptive statistics and clustering.
Case Selection Rationale
A single case (Aragon platform) was selected due to its scale (5,000 DAOs, $6 billion in assets) and diversity. The 40 DAOs analyzed represent varied domains and governance models, ensuring representativeness.
Data Collection Methods
Primary Data: Peña-Calvin et al. (2023) dataset from IEEE DataPort, covering 40 DAOs across general, voting, and token schemes.
Secondary Data: 24 web sources (e.g., Investopedia, ScienceDirect) and two X posts (@AragonProject) for global DAO trends, governance insights, and platform updates.
Document Analysis: Aragon’s website, whitepapers, and public platforms (CoinMarketCap, Snapshot) for contextual data.
Ethical Considerations
No human subjects were involved. Public datasets and sources were used, ensuring transparency and proper citation.
Data Analysis Approach
Thematic Analysis: Identified governance, tokenomics, and sustainability themes.
Statistical Analysis: Replicated Peña-Calvin et al.’s K-Means clustering and Fisher’s exact test to validate archetypes and associations.
Comparative Analysis: Cross-referenced findings with external sources to enhance generalizability.
Validity and Reliability
Triangulation of primary and secondary sources ensured robustness.
Peer-reviewed references (e.g., IEEE, ScienceDirect) enhanced credibility.
Limitations (e.g., data gaps) were transparently acknowledged.

4. Case Description
Background
Aragon, founded in 2016, enables DAO creation on Ethereum and sidechains, offering tools like Aragon Court and the Aragon App. By 2025, it supports 1,700 active DAOs, down from 5,000, possibly due to competition or governance disputes (e.g., 2023 ANT tokenholder ban). Its ANT token facilitates platform governance, though power concentration persists.
Timeline of Events
2016: Aragon founded, focusing on digital jurisdictions.
2018–2020: Growth to 5,000 DAOs, managing $6 billion.
2023: Merger with Nation3; treasury dispute highlights governance flaws.
2025: Active DAOs decline, but Aragon remains a leader in DeFi and tech.

Key Actors and Stakeholders
Aragon Association: Manages platform development.
DAO Creators: Communities and developers using Aragon’s tools.
Tokenholders (ANT): Influence platform and DAO governance.
External Platforms: DeepDAO, Messari, and Snapshot provide data and analytics.
Contextual Factors
Economic: Crypto market volatility affects DAO treasuries.
Cultural: Blockchain’s ethos of decentralization drives DAO adoption.
Political: Jurisdictions like Wyoming recognize DAOs, but global regulation lags.
Social: Community size correlates with sustainability, per Peña-Calvin et al. (2023).

Thematic Analysis
Plutocratic Governance: 77.5% of DAOs use token-weighted voting, concentrating power among large tokenholders, as seen in Aragon’s 2023 dispute.
Domain Concentration: Finance and technology dominate, limiting applications in healthcare or civic governance.
Sustainability: Small DAOs (<100 members) face 30% inactivity rates; community size correlates with treasury size (Spearman’s coefficient: 0.78).
Linkage with Theoretical Framework
Agency theory explains token-driven governance, where incentives align with token ownership, but stewardship theory highlights collaborative ideals undermined by plutocracy. The socio-technical framework reveals tensions between technical efficiency (smart contracts) and social equity (voting power).
Interpretation
Findings align with Bellavitis et al. (2023), who note governance risks in token concentration. Small DAOs’ struggles reflect broader trends, with DeepDAO reporting 20 tokenholders as a sustainability threshold. Aragon’s tools enable innovation but require governance reforms to ensure equity.

6. Discussion
Critical Evaluation
The categorization reveals Aragon DAOs’ strengths in scalability and transparency but exposes plutocratic tendencies and domain limitations. Token-weighted voting risks governance attacks, as seen in Build Finance DAO’s 2022 takeover. Small DAOs’ inactivity suggests resource constraints, consistent with global trends.
Implications
Theory: The archetypes refine DAO taxonomies, supporting cross-platform comparisons.
Policy: Regulators must address token concentration and legal status, as Wyoming’s DAO laws suggest.
Practice: DAO creators should adopt hybrid voting models and target non-financial sectors.

Reflection on Method
The instrumental case study effectively leverages Peña-Calvin et al.’s (2023) dataset, enhanced by external sources. However, reliance on curated data limits generalizability, and qualitative member perspectives could deepen insights.
Limitations
Data gaps (47.5% treasury, 25% community size) introduce bias.
Single-platform focus excludes DAOstack or DAOhaus.
Limited peer-reviewed DAO studies constrain literature depth.

7. Conclusion
Summary
Aragon DAOs, categorized into general, voting, and token archetypes, dominate finance and technology but face governance and sustainability challenges. Token-weighted voting undermines equity, and small DAOs struggle to remain active.
Answers to Research Questions
DAOs cluster into finance (GEN-1), technology (GEN-2), and diverse archetypes, with plutocratic (VOT-1) and governance-focused tokens (TOK-1) prevalent.
Token-weighted voting risks inequity; community size drives sustainability.
Hybrid voting, non-financial applications, and regulation are critical for DAO evolution.
Final Reflections
Aragon’s tools position it as a DAO leader, but governance reforms are essential to realize democratic potential. The study’s framework is a valuable tool for future research.
Recommendations for Future Research
Compare archetypes across platforms (e.g., DAOhaus, DAOstack).
Analyze voting participation rates and off-chain governance.
Explore DAOs in healthcare or civic data using qualitative methods.
